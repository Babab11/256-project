Karim -I was in charge of a number of important tasks in my role that helped the application develop. First, I made sure the JSON file I used to store the data complied with the project's requirements. I also contributed significantly to the JavaScript codes' logic implementation  which made it possible for data to be converted for display purposes in an effective manner. Furthermore, I actively participated in the creation of the application's overall logic, working with the team to guarantee consistency and efficiency in its operation.
